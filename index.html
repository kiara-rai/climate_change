			<p> The climate change and ecological crisis is one of the greatests threats the world has faced. Yet, majority of the population is not aware of the causes and grave impacts of this change. We must educate ourselves and eachother in order to battle the crisis together.</p>
			<p>Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. The shifts can be natural, due to changes in the sun’s activity or large volcanic eruptions. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas, and additionally through countless habits that humans pursue.</p>
			<p>Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun’s heat and raising temperatures.</p>
			<p>Frequent wildfires, hurricanes, heatwaves, floods, storms, droughts, and so are becoming normalized. These are increasing in frequency and becoming more extreme. Natural disasters increasingly appear less and less natural. </p>
			<p>Let's make learning interactive and learn about climate change so we know how to play our part in preventing it!</p>
