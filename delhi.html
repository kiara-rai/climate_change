<div id="title">This is what New Delhi should look like in 2070 if we continue our current lifestyle and habits.</div>
<div id="box"></div>
<div id="text">In 2070, if current lifestyle and habits persist in New Delhi, the city might resemble a scene from a dystopian sci-fi movie. Air pollution could have reached alarming levels, with thick smog engulfing the skyline on most days. Citizens might rely heavily on air purifiers and wear advanced filtration masks just to step outside.
The city could experience more frequent and intense heatwaves, with temperatures soaring well above what residents currently consider normal. Heat-related illnesses could become a major public health concern, particularly among vulnerable populations.Changes in precipitation patterns could lead to unpredictable monsoon seasons, alternating between periods of heavy rainfall and drought. This could disrupt agricultural cycles, affecting food security and livelihoods for millions of people dependent on farming.
With glaciers melting and river flows dwindling, New Delhi might struggle to meet its water demands. Groundwater depletion could worsen, leading to sinking water tables and increasing reliance on expensive desalination technologies or long-distance water transfers.

Overall, New Delhi in 2070 could be a paradoxical blend of technological innovation and environmental degradation, highlighting the urgent need for transformative change to secure a more sustainable future.</div>
<div id="title2">What can we do to stop New Delhi from looking like this?</div>
<div id="text2">
We as people can play a crucial role in mitigating climate change and building a more sustainable future for the city. Here are some actions we can take: <li>
Use Public Transportation: Opt for buses, metro trains, or other forms of public transportation instead of driving alone. This reduces the carbon emissions associated with individual vehicle usage. <li>
Walk or Cycle: Choose to walk or cycle for short distances instead of driving. Not only does this reduce carbon emissions, but it also promotes physical activity and improves personal health.<li>
Drive Efficiently: If driving is necessary, practice fuel-efficient driving habits such as maintaining steady speeds, avoiding rapid acceleration and braking, and keeping vehicles properly maintained. Consider carpooling or ridesharing to reduce the number of vehicles on the road.<li>
Switch to Electric Vehicles: Consider switching to electric vehicles (EVs) if feasible. EVs produce fewer emissions compared to traditional gasoline or diesel vehicles, especially when powered by renewable energy sources. <li>
Reduce Energy Consumption: Conserve energy at home by using energy-efficient appliances, turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and properly insulating homes to reduce heating and cooling needs. Consider investing in rooftop solar panels to generate clean energy.<li>
Support Renewable Energy: Choose electricity providers that offer renewable energy options. Supporting renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower helps reduce reliance on fossil fuels and lowers carbon emissions associated with electricity generation. <li>
Conserve Water: Conserve water to reduce energy consumption associated with water pumping, treatment, and heating. Minimize water waste by fixing leaks, using water-efficient fixtures, and practicing water-saving habits. <li>
Offset Carbon Emissions: Consider offsetting unavoidable carbon emissions by investing in carbon offset projects. These projects support initiatives such as reforestation, renewable energy development, and energy efficiency improvements to compensate for carbon emissions.<li>
Advocate for Change: Advocate for policies and initiatives that support carbon emission reduction at the local, national, and international levels. Support initiatives such as carbon pricing, renewable energy incentives, and sustainable transportation policies to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy.</div>
